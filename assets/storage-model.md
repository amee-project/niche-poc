## NICHE Storage Model

### Summary
The NICHE should keep track of a set of metadata for the NICH itself (name, population, health, etc.). It should also keep a list of any STIG or PHERRO 'living' in this NICHE along with their status and other public metadata.

> This implies a data model for STIGs and PHERROs, too.

 * Assume STIGs are created here (HTTP POST?). Assume PHERROs "visit" here (HTTP PUT?).
